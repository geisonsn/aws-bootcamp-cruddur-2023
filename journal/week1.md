# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Knowledge acquired
- Using and create standlone database that emulates a DynamoDB service;
- Using the AWS CLI to create tables and items, list tables, and get content from tables.

## Conclusions
This week was less busy and challenging than the previous one because I already had reasonable knowledge of the main subject of it, which was Docker and containerization. Therefore I used it to reinforce the knowledge I had, and advance in some new topics I found relevant.
